      I made this website from scratch using GitHub Pages+Jekyll and the <a href="https://bulma.io">Bulma</a> CSS framework.

      Inspired by my work as a radio DJ, I made <a href="https://devpost.com/software/bleepradio">this project</a> at SB Hacks VI as a bit of a joke,
      wherein lyrics to music can be censored and read back in a robotic monotone as a randomly selected backing track plays.
      I worked on integrating the Google Text-to-Speech API into our project and deploying it to the Google Cloud Platform.

      <a href="https://devpost.com/software/wishful">This project</a> was an opportunity for me to learn more about the front-end side of web dev,
      so I mostly worked on the Javascript and CSS side of things, using Bulma (again) for the look and feel, and Vue.js for interactivity.
      The purpose of this site is to create collaborative wishlists that also text you when you choose to purchase the same thing as
      another person, so as to allow you to communicate with each other and share the cost.
