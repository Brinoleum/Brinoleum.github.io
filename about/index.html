    <p>
      I'm Brian, and I am currently a second year computer science major at UC Irvine.
      When I'm not coding or messing about with my Linux desktop setup, I can also be
      found making memes on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/294122234358505">Zotmeme.jpg</a>
      or playing the body electric on <a href="https://kuci.org">KUCI</a>, 88.9 FM in Irvine.
