							My name is Brian Chu (he/him/his) and I am a third year computer science student at UC Irvine (rip 'em
							Anteaters! ZotðŸ¤˜ zotðŸ¤˜ zotðŸ¤˜).
							I like solving problems in new and interesting ways (and potentially creating some new ones in the
							process). I have recently concluded my summer
							internship as a software engineer at Northrop Grumman, and am currently seeking positions for the 2021
							internship season.

							*Fun fact: I'm a sucker for neat tech and that selfie was taken with a phone app that lets you wave your
							hands to set off the countdown timer.
							Just a little tidbit that I thought was neat.

							When I'm not programming something cool or hanging out with my friends, you can catch me on the airwaves
							at KUCI, 88.9 FM in Irvine
							If you're one of those technically advanced people who don't use radios (to be fair, who does nowadays)
							you can also find me online at <a href="https://kuci.org">kuci.org</a>
							or follow my show blog at <a href="https://7deadlysynths.kuci.org">7deadlysynths.kuci.org</a>

						<h4 class="title is-4">ACM</h4>
						<p>
							I'm a part of the <a href="https://acm-uci.org">ACM</a> chapter here at UCI, where we solve programming
							problems, talk about interesting programming techniques, and eat pizza twice a week.
							(as the public relations chair/director of innovation I'm contractually obligated to tell you about our
							club).
							We also compete in various competitions, such as IEEExtreme (where my team, "sudo rm -rf", got 800th-ish
							place out of 4000 worldwide), and ICPC.
