<div class="about">
  <p>
    I'm Brian, and I am currently a second year computer science major at UC Irvine.
    When I'm not coding or messing about with my Linux desktop setup, I can also be
    found making memes on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/294122234358505">Zotmeme.jpg</a>
    or playing the body electric on <a href="https://kuci.org">KUCI</a>, 88.9 FM in Irvine.
  </p>

  <h4>Fun facts about me:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>I am a sucker for the bookselling booth at the UCI vendor fair and have purchased four books and two prints</li>
    <li>Sometimes when no one's around, I will sometimes dance to music I'm listening to (but really awkwardly)</li>
    <li>Emacs > Vim, especially with the evil mode that also includes all the keybindings</li>
    <li>Scheme > Common Lisp (haha just kidding, every flavor of lisp has its uses)</li>
    <li>Cats >>> Dogs</li>
    <li>(parenthetical statements are awesome and I sometimes overuse them)(and even abuse them)(like this)(are run-on parenthetical statements a thing?)</li>
  </ul>
